        <p>I really like cats, cats are the most important thing to me in my entire life. Cats are very intresting and funny creatures, but they are the absolute best. Cats have a lot of intresting features that a lot of other animals do not have, for example cats can move their ears 180 degrees to be able to hear stuff from behind them easily. Cats also have retractable claws that come out when they need to use them, for example when they are hunting, climbing, or defending themselves from other creatures. Cats are really silly animals and aree also really stubborn, if you annoy a cat, they will hold you account for it and will be petty about it. There are also a bunch of different breeds of cats, which I will put a list below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Siamese</li>
            <li>Persian</li>
            <li>Tuxedo</li>
            <li>Flame Point</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those are only a few of the many breeds of cats, anyways, thank you for taking time to look at this website of a think I like, aka cats!</p>
