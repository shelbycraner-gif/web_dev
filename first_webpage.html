        <h1>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</h1>
        <p>My Little Pony is all about how friendship can be the cure of everything. It follows a main pony called Twilight Sparkle who moved to Ponyville with her pet Spike. In Ponyville Twilight Sparkle met her friends Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Rarity. They go on adventures to defeat evil creatures and/or to befriend them using the Magic of Friendship. Twilight Sparkle writes a letter to Princess Celestia every week about the lessons that she learned that week about friendship. Twilight goes through major character devlopment throughout the 6 seasons of the show because of all of the lessons she had learned by communicating her problems with her friends and helping them with their problems.</p>
        <h2>Why I Like It</h2>
        <p>I like My Little Pony because it shows that friendship can fix problems just through communication. All of the friends with My Little Pony have their own problems and they help eachother through the tough times. I like it a lot because it also shows that you can make friends even when you struggle to me them. You can make friends that have a completely different personality than you do and still get along with them.</p>
