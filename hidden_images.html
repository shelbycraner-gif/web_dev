        <p>McDonalds Mocha Frappe's are really good and are my personal favorite type of coffee to ever exist. They have chocolate drizzle on top of the whipped cream, in the frappe, and sometimes around the inside of the cup. The frappe is a blended creamy coffee that can be served with many different things and can have many different flavors that is almost always topped with sweet creamy whipped cream. Frappes and Mochas are really common all around the world; most of the time, frappes are reffered to as coffee-based drinks but they can also come in many different flavors like fruity flavors, especially strawberry and mango type flavors.</p>
        <p>Here is a list of things you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <p>Coffee, make sure this is brewed strong because weak or less strong coffee will not give the right taste</p>
            <p>Sugar, you need this to sweeten up the coffee</p>
            <p>Milk, you may use cows milk (2% or higher) or unsweetened almond or coconut milk</p>
            <p>Chocolate Syrup, you don't need a bunch of it, </p>
            <p>Whipped Cream (this is optional, but it tastes better with it)</p>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are some instructions that will help you make it:</p>
        <p>First things first, make sure your coffee is slightly cooled. Then you should pour that brewed coffee into an ice mold. Next you need to put them into the freezer for around 3-4 hours or until fully frozen. After the frozen coffee is done freezing, put them in a blender along with sugar, milk, and chocolate syrup, blend for roughly 2 minutes or until desired texture at either a medium or high speed. Lastly, pour the frappe into a cup of your choice, top with whipped cream and a straw, enjoy!</p>
