    <div id="About!">
        <p>Capitol Reef is a national park in Southern-Central Utah that is roughly 60 miles long and 6 miles wide. Capitol Reef is filled with red rocks that tower over everyone and everything. Captiol Reef has a bunch of petroglyphs that cover the sides and "walls" of the big red rocks; petroglyphs are etchings that are carved into rock walls, these ones in particular are made by the fremont and Ancestral Puebloan people and they told their stories through petroglyphs. Things you are able to do in Capitol Reef can range from camping, hiking, cayonerring and slot canyon hikes, scenic drives along Utah highway 24, and even more!</p>
