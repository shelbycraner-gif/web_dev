        <p>Capitol Reef National Park has a bunch of pretyt views, especially that one right there. At night you can see all of the pretty stars in the sky because there is no light pollution. With how many staars you can see during the night time, you can see the MilkyWay galaxy and so much more. Capitol Reef is really pretty at night and if you have ever been, you know how pretty it is. The night being so clear and the stars being so visible, makes it really easy to stargaze while camping and everything while you are there</p>

    <h2>About!</h2>
    <div id="About!">
        <p>Capitol Reef is a national park in Southern-Central Utah that is roughly 60 miles long and 6 miles wide. Capitol Reef is filled with red rocks that tower over everyone and everything. Captiol Reef has a bunch of petroglyphs that cover the sides and "walls" of the big red rocks; petroglyphs are etchings that are carved into rock walls, these ones in particular are made by the fremont and Ancestral Puebloan people and they told their stories through petroglyphs. Things you are able to do in Capitol Reef can range from camping, hiking, cayoneering and slot canyon hikes, scenic drives along Utah highway 24, and even more! Captiol Reef has a bunch of different places to hike and everything else that was stated before.</p>
